            Flynt was built by people who have lived the reality of revenue and client acquisition for over 15 years — recruiters, business developers, agency founders who know exactly what it takes to generate consistent momentum in this business.
          </p>
          <p>We also know what stops it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-problem">
          <h2>The problem we lived.</h2>
          <p>
            The research burden. The tab-hopping. The rebuilt spreadsheets. The three hours every Monday morning spent trying to figure out who to call — before making a single call.
          </p>
          <p>
            The landscape of client acquisition has changed. Relying on your network, sending generic outreach, and making occasional calls no longer creates the kind of consistent momentum a serious operation requires. Today, winning means knowing more, knowing it faster, and knowing it before your competition does.
          </p>
          <p>
            That requires intelligence infrastructure — not more tools, not better templates, not a bigger list.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-solution">
          <h2>Why we built Flynt.</h2>
          <p>
            We built Flynt because we felt that friction firsthand — and because no tool we tried actually solved it. They gave us data. They gave us outreach automation. They gave us dashboards. None of them gave us intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flynt is the client acquisition preparation layer revenue teams never had. It operates continuously, surfaces signal-driven client prospects, and delivers structured intelligence so disciplined operators can spend their time on the conversations that generate revenue — not the research that precedes them. For recruiters specifically: Flynt finds the companies that need you. You bring the skill to win them and place the talent they need.
          </p>

        <div class="about-mission">
          <blockquote>
            Our goal is simple: remove the research burden from revenue work. When opportunity flow is consistent and intelligence is structured, disciplined operators compound their results. Flynt exists to make that possible.
          </blockquote>
          <p class="about-final">
            Built for operators who believe in leverage — not shortcuts.
